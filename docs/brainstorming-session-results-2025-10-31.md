# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** fredag 31. oktober 2025
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** The AI Study Buddy application

**Session Goals:** To see if there are aspects of the application that haven't been thought about.

**Techniques Used:** "What If" Scenarios, Pre-mortem, SCAMPER

**Total Ideas Generated:** (Not explicitly counted, but numerous ideas were generated across techniques)

### Key Themes Identified:

*   **Expanding Scope:** Beyond students to teachers and general learners.
*   **Core Functionality Enhancement:** Improving quiz quality, adding diverse quiz formats, and enhancing note-taking with rich text and multi-file input.
*   **User Experience:** Ensuring ease of use, intuitive navigation, and persistent data.
*   **AI Magnification:** Moving beyond basic quiz generation to performance analysis and personalized learning.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Addressing potential failures related to quiz quality and core functionality bugs.

## Technique Sessions

### "What If" Scenarios

*   **What if you had unlimited resources?**
    *   Expand target audience beyond students to include teachers and general learners.
    *   Include all "nice to have" features from the proposal.
    *   Handle all file types with no size limitations.
    *   Import multiple files for each lecture.
    *   Generate quizzes that target the full material from all imported files.

*   **What if the AI Study Buddy was designed to discourage learning or make it inefficient?**
    *   Difficult to navigate design.
    *   Nothing could be saved (no persistence).
    *   Cannot go back to previous quizzes.

*   **What if the problem of 'inefficiently processing large volumes of study material' didn't exist at all?**
    *   The app could process all file types with no size limitations.
    *   Opportunity to import multiple files for each lecture to give the student a broader understanding.
    *   Quizzes that targeted the full material.

### Pre-mortem

*   **Poor Quiz Quality:**
    *   AI struggles to summarize content into relevant questions.
    *   Difficulty of questions is not well-calibrated (too easy or too hard).
    *   Lack of a feedback loop for quality control.
    *   No mechanism for progressive difficulty (e.g., starting easy and progressing to difficult).
    *   Problem with prompting the AI model.

*   **Core Functionality Bugs:**
    *   Users struggle to create accounts.
    *   Technical problems preventing users from creating courses and lecture notes.

### SCAMPER

*   **Substitute:**
    *   Expand quiz formats to include fill-in-the-blank and true/false questions.
    *   Consider a rich-text editor for notes.
*   **Combine:**
    *   Integrate notes and quizzes into a single view (quiz questions appearing alongside notes).
*   **Adapt:**
    *   Implement drag-and-drop functionality for multiple files into a text box.
*   **Modify (Magnify/Minify):**
    *   Magnify the AI's role to include performance analysis and personalized recommendations.
*   **Put to another use:**
    *   Repurpose the quiz generation engine for broader, topic-based quizzes (e.g., for general knowledge quizzes).
*   **Eliminate (or Relocate):**
    *   Relocate the basic quiz listing to be under specific courses for better organization.
*   **Reverse/Rearrange:**
    *   Keep the existing workflow order.
